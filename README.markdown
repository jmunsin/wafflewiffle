Problem to solve
================

When emptying my digital camera or camera phone, I dump the photos into a
director with a descriptive name (date + a 2-3 word description). My photos
directory look more or less like this:

* 2007/
	* 2007-11-02-short-description1
	* 2007-11-02-short-description2
* 2008/

I like to leave my images untouched on the disk and serve them from my computer.

But I still need to:

* thumbnail
* rotate
* what else?

This is what wifflewaffle does.
